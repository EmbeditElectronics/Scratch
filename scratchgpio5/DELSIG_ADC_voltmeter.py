"""
This program demonstrates basic usage of the RPiSoC's DELSIG ADC as a Voltmeter.

The program will output the voltage of whatever is connected to P15[5] every .1
seconds.

Note that P5[0], which is a 3.3V pin (slightly higher when powering with the Pi)
is initialized as HIGH, and so connecting to to P0[3] should show between 3.2
and 3.5V.

The Power supply on each port should read close to 5V as well.
You can confirm the accuracy with a Voltmeter

Note: Px[y] means Port x, Pin y.
