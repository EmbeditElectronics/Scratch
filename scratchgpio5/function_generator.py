"""
This program demonstrates the use of the RPiSoC's WaveDAC.

It will begin by initializing a WaveDAC object and generating it's default wave.
It will then wait for the user to choose to generate a new wave, and ask for
the configuration details.

It will then stop the current wave, load the new configuration, and restart the wave

To see the desired functionality, connect P0[0] to an Oscilliscope.

Note:
    Px[y] means Port x Pin y
